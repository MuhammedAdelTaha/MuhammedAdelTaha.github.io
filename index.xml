      <description>Introduction This project discusses the main differences between the different types of AI Search Algorithms like the completeness and the optimality of the algorithm We used the 8-puzzle problem as an application that demonstrates these differences Depth First Search Data Structure: Stack Completeness: Not complete Optimality: Not optimal Time: O(bm) Space: O(b * m) b is the branching factor m is the maximum possible search tree depth DFS is good only when it comes to space complexity Breadth First Search Data Structure: Queue Completeness: Complete Optimality: Optimal Time: O(bs) Space: O(bs) b is the branching factor s is the level where the goal state is present BFS is not very well dealing with space BFS can find the optimal solution only if all costs are equal to one A* Search with Manhattan heuristic Data Structure: Priority Queue Completeness: Complete Optimality: Optimal A* Search Always finds the optimal solution A* Search considers the past cost and the upcoming heuristic cost Manhattan distance = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| A* Search with Euclidean heuristic Data Structure: Priority Queue Completeness: Complete Optimality: Optimal A* Search Always finds the optimal solution A* Search considers the past cost and the upcoming heuristic cost Euclidean distance = √((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2) Test Cases &amp;amp; Comparisons Test #1 Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 0 - Unsolvable test case -</description>
